# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a modern, single-page portfolio website built with React to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. The site is fully responsive, interactive, and designed with a clean, component-based architecture.

### **Technologies Used**

* **React:** The core library used for building the user interface.

### **Key Features & Concepts**

* **Component-Based Architecture:** The website is built using small, reusable components (e.g., Navbar, SkillItem, ProjectCard).
* **State Management:** The `useState` hook is used to manage UI state, such as the active filters in the projects section.
* **Dynamic Rendering:** Project cards are rendered dynamically from a data array, making the portfolio easy to update.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully mobile-friendly, ensuring a great user experience on any device.
